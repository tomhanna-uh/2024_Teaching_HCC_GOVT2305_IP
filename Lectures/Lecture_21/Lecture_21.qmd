        - Civil War and Reconstruction: Expansion of federal agencies.
        - Progressive Era: Creation of regulatory agencies.
        - New Deal: Massive growth in response to the Great Depression.
        - Post-WWII: Continued expansion and specialization.
        - Modern Era: Focus on efficiency, accountability, and reform.


## Who Does the Bureaucracy Answer To?

- Political appointees (~4,000; ~1,200 with Senate confirmation)
- Civil Service System (over 2 million employees)

 Political appointees
        
        - President
        - Cabinet Secretaries
        - Agency heads
        - Political appointees are responsible for setting policy and direction.
        - They are also responsible for oversight and accountability.
        - They are not responsible for day-to-day operations.
        


## Who Does the Bureaucracy Answer To?

- Civil service system

        - grew as reaction to 1800s spoils system
        - nonpartisan
        - professional
        - career employees
        - protected from political influence, firing for political reasons
        - merit-based hiring and promotion
        - Hatch Act: limits political activities of civil servants
        - Whistleblower protections


## Question

> Given that civil service appointees are exempt from firing or discipline for policy disagreements, how does this fit with the idea of the elected President as the head of the executive branch?



## Bureaucracy and the Executive Branch

- Cabinet Departments: 15 Cabinet departments, each headed by a Secretary (or the Attorney General for Justice Department)
- Independent Agencies: Unique nature and relationship to the President.
