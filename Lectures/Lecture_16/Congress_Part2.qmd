## Types of Bills

- Public Bills:

        - These bills apply to the general public and propose laws that affect the entire nation. Examples include tax laws, healthcare reform, or national defense authorizations.
        
- Private Bills: 

        - Deal with individual matters, such as immigration cases or claims against the government. They affect specific individuals or organizations.
        
- Joint Resolutions: 

        - Essentially the same as bills, and if passed, have the force of law. Often used for proposing constitutional amendments or declaring war.
        
- Concurrent Resolutions: 

        - Used to express the opinion of both the House and Senate, but they do not have the force of law and do not require the President's signature. Often used for budgetary purposes or to set a date for adjournment.
        
- Simple Resolutions: 

        - Deal with matters entirely within the authority of one house of Congress. They do not have the force of law and are not sent to the President. Used for things like establishing rules of procedure within a chamber.



## Types of Laws

- Statutory
- Constitutional 
- Common law



        
## Types of Laws

- Statutory Laws: passed by Congress

        - These are the laws passed by Congress and are codified in the United States Code. 
        - They cover a wide range of issues, from criminal justice to environmental protection.

- Constitutional Law: not passed by Congress (Constitution and the courts)

        - This is the supreme law of the land, derived from the U.S. Constitution. 
        - It outlines the structure of government, fundamental rights, and the limits of governmental power.
        - Generally interpreted by the judiciary, especially the Supreme Court not by Congress

- Common law: not passed by Congress (the courts)

        - judge made law, not made by Congress
        - inherited from England's common law as of 1791
        - referenced in the Constitution, specifically Amendment 7

- Select Committees: Temporary committees created for a specific purpose, such as investigating an issue or conducting a study.

- Expertise:

        - Committees allow members of Congress to specialize in specific policy areas, developing in-depth knowledge.

- Efficiency:

        - Committee hearings provide an opportunity for the public to voice their concerns and contribute to the legislative process.
