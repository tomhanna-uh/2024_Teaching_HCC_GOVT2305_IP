# Ideals in early American Government?


## Purpose and Dangers of Federal Government

The overall questions common to all people are:

- What is the purpose of government?
- What are the dangers of government?

## Answers

A modern restatement of the philosophy of the Founding, Classical Liberalism:

:::


## The starting point: 1775 - 1783

## What is classical liberalism?

::: {.custom-style style="font-size: 120px;"}

:::


## What is self-government?

What is self-government?

Two parts:

- individual's govern their own behavior

::: {.custom-style style="font-size: 120px;"}

:::

## How can we achieve self-government?

::: {.custom-style style="font-size: 120px;"}
Splitting up power – to avoid any one person or group from becoming like a monarch or tyrant
:::


## How can we achieve self-government?

Splitting up power was the primary focus of the American Founding after the Revolution

    - State vs Federal
    - Different branches of government
    
    

## What about other issues?

- The focus on splitting up power missed some other issues
- Some of this was compromise

    - 14 of the states were independent nations before becoming states
    - Federal government needs enough power but not too much (Constitutional Convention)
    - Preventing bad long-term decisions (Amendment process, Bill of Rights)





# Missing the Ideal 

## Why do we care?

- What are the lessons for our own time?
- What issues do we need to continue fixing?
- Or do we throw it all out?


## Early Problems with American Government

- Slavery
- Limited rights of women
- Limited voting

## Why were these problems?

::: {.custom-style style="font-size: 120px;"}
Aside from the moral question, **What was the big issue that all of these shared?**
:::


## Why were these problems?

- **They conflict with classical liberal ideals!**


## Why were these problems?

- **They conflict with classical liberal ideals!**
- **America was imperfect by its own standards**


## America started out imperfect

- **America was imperfect by its own standards**
- **Some of this was compromise**



## Slavery and Classical Liberal ideals

- Slavery conflicts with the ideal of individual liberty



## Slavery and Classical Liberal ideals

- Slavery conflicts with the ideal of individual liberty
- Slavery **conflicts with the basis of property rights**

        - The basis of property rights is that individuals own themselves and their labor
        - The product of their labor is their property
        - Taking the product of someone else's labor other than by voluntary exchange is violating their right to property


## Limited rights of women

- Women's rights to own property were severely restricted
- This **necessarily** restricted their liberty
- There were explicit restrictions on women's liberty

## Limited voting

- Voting was

    - Restricted to land owners
    - Restricted by race
    - Restricted by gender




# Evolution of American Government

## Moving forward

- **Even A lot of the Founders recognized the problems**
- **Evolution and future solutions were expected - Amendments**

## How have some of these problems evolved?

- Slavery 1865^[But this didn't resolve issues of race]
- Property rights for women - 1900^[State by state]
- Voting rights - 1865, 1920, 1969^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_voting_rights_in_the_United_States]



# Thinking about solutions

## Solutions? What is still wrong? What is right?


- Work to fix remaining (classical) liberal inconsistencies and contradictions? Rethink exact limits and role of government in a basically liberal framework?
       
        - Traditional Republicans and Democrats
        - Libertarians
        - Forward Party 


## Solutions? What is still wrong? What is right?

- Retain the liberal structure
- Some other standard - some form of authoritarianism?

        - Populist Economic Nationalism (Trumpism)
        - Populist Socialism (Sanders, The Squad)
        
- How much of the current structure should remain? How much is safe to tinker with? Increase or decrease liberalism (limits on power)?


## Solutions? What is still wrong? What is right?

- New problem: Massive new restrictions on individual empowerment at the federal level

        - Surveillance state
        - Censorship of speech and assembly
        - Economic restrictions
        - Political restrictions
        - Social restrictions 
        - Cultural restrictions
        - Educational restrictions
        - Health restrictions
        - Environmental restrictions
        - Technological restrictions
        - Religious restrictions
